      <h1>What Is This?</h1>
      <p>
        The world has changed drastically from half a century ago when labour
        was the primary resource for production in a factory-fueled economy.
        Today, knowledge is the primary resource for production. In this
        information age, technology has taken production to whole new heights
        and jobs require whole new levels of skill. The only problem... is that
        there's too much out there. How can we possibly specialize or focus when
        there is so much to pay attention to?
      </p>
      <p>
        That's what this Compass Training program is for. We have synthesized
        key lessons from a curated list of books into bite-sized exercises that
        can easily be absorbed and retained. Not only that, it doesn't matter
        who you are or what you do. This training will train an ability that
        serves as the foundation to any area of success in your life â€” the area
        of discipline. Simply put, this training ensures that you will start to
        choose what you want most over what you want now and lead the life that
        you have always dreamed of but never worked hard enough towards.
